# Neural_Style_transfer
Neural Style Transfer is a technique that uses deep learning to combine the content of one image with the artistic style of another.magine you have a photo of yourself and a painting by Van Gogh.  Neural Style Transfer can take your photo and render it in Van Gogh's style, preserving the content of your photo (you, the background, etc.)It works by using convolutional neural networks to analyze the content and style of the images separately and then recombining them in a new image.  Essentially, it's a way to create artistic variations of images automatically.
I  did this as a part of one of my projects in college
